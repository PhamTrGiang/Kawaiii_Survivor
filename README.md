# 🕹️ Kawaii Survivor

**Kawaii Survivor** is a 2D top-down survival game inspired by **Brotato** and **Vampire Survivors**, developed using Unity and C#. This project was created as part of a game development course to explore core gameplay systems such as wave spawning, AI behavior, skill upgrades, and performance optimization.

Players control a character that **automatically attacks**, dodges incoming enemies, collects experience points (XP), and selects random upgrades to survive for as long as possible against endless waves of increasingly difficult enemies.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- **Auto-Attack System**: Player automatically attacks enemies based on weapon stats.
- **Wave System**: Enemies spawn in timed waves, with difficulty increasing over time.
- **Enemy AI**: Basic AI logic – enemies chase and collide with the player to deal damage.
- **Upgrade System**: After each wave, players choose from randomized upgrades (e.g., more damage, faster attacks, movement speed).
- **Player Stats**: Health, speed, damage, and level-up system based on XP.
- **UI/UX**: Displays health bar, survival timer, level, and upgrade choices.
- **Game Over State**: Game ends when the player runs out of health.
